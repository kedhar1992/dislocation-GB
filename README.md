#The dislocation-GB interaction was studied using numerical calculations of slip transmission parameters (STP) and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS). The parameters from both STP and MDS are fed as inputs to machine learning (ML) models.

#Here, you can find three folders with each containing STP, MDS, and ML.
