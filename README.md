#This work is based on the published work "".

#The dislocation-GB interaction was studied using numerical calculations of slip transmission parameters (STP) and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS). The parameters from both STP and MDS are fed as inputs to machine learning (ML) models.

#Here, you can find three folders with each containing STP, MDS, and ML. 
1. Open 'STP.m' using matlab with other *.m files in the same folder. The code Stabix was used. 
2. The input script for MDS is ''
3. Open the files '' for ML

#If you use these scripts, kindly cite "".
